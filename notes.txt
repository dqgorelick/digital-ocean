We will call this the physics update loop, which is run every 15ms (about 66 updates per second).
The second update we can call the server update loop, which is run at a slower rate, every 45ms (about 22 updates per second). In the server update loop we send the state of the server to all clients.

server loop

RequestAnimationFrame loop:

Clear canvas
Draw info/status
Handle input (sends input messages to server)
Update position (using client prediction)
Move the other clients based on the server position (interpolation)
Draw players on canvas

The interpolation/smoothing of the other clients. This is handled in this fashion:

Store the network messages from the server about other clients, for at least 100ms
Interpolate between a last known position, and a newer position in time (100ms behind the server time)
Draw the interpolated clients at the interpolated position.

game status:
player statuses
{
    id {
        pos {
            x
            y
        }
        inputs {

        }
    }
}
